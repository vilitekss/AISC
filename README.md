- **Real-Time Threat Detection:** AI-driven identification of scams and fraudulent behaviors.
- **Comprehensive Protection:** Coverage from wallet transactions to smart contract audits.
- **Decentralized Collaboration:** Community-driven blacklists and shared data improve accuracy and transparency.
